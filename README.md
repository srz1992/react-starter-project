# react-starter-project

This is my first time making a smartphone app in React Native. 

It is based off of this tutorial on Youtube:

It is pretty easy for those who have a background in ReactJS. 

I would recommend checking it out if you're interested in getting into React Native.

However, please take note that the Navigator component used in the last part of the tutorial has been taken out of React. 

I used the npm package react-navigation in its place. You can read up on how to implement it here:
